This project focuses on predicting the "Humid" target column using neural networks and decision trees. It aims to provide insights into the humidity levels based on various customer variables.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following variables:

- `Custid`: Customer ID, unique
- `Dayswus`: Days since last purchase
- Age: Age of the customer
- Education: Customer's education level
- Income: Customer's income
- Kidhome: Number of kids at home
- Teenhome: Number of teenagers at home
- Freq: Purchase frequency
- Recency: Recency of purchase
- Monetary: Monetary value of purchases
- LTV: Customer lifetime value
- Perdeal: Percentage of deals purchased
- Dryred: Dry red wine preference
- Sweetred: Sweet red wine preference
- Drywh: Dry white wine preference
- Sweetwh: Sweet white wine preference
- Dessert: Dessert wine preference
- Exotic: Exotic wine preference
- WebPurchase: Web purchase behavior
- WebVisit: Web visit behavior
- ExpressedPreference: Expressed wine preference, rejected
- NPS: Net Promoter Score, rejected
- Humid: Target variable, binary

## Model Building

The prediction task was performed using two machine learning algorithms: neural networks and decision trees. Various features were utilized to train the models and predict the "Humid" target column.

## Predicting Unseen Data

Using the best-performing model, I applied it to unseen data to predict. The results of the predicted unseen data are used to calculate Return On Investment for the marketing campaigns. 

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code:
